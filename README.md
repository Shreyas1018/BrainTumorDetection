# Brain Tumor Detection
#Problem: 
Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Manual analysis of medical images such as MRI scans is time-consuming, prone to human error, and requires specialized expertise.

#Solution: 
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate brain tumor detection in MRI images. CNNs excel in image processing tasks due to their ability to extract hierarchical features and patterns.

#Methodology

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

A dataset of MRI brain scans with diverse tumor types and non-tumor cases is collected from reliable source.
Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/data)
Images will be preprocessed, including normalization, resizing, and potentially data augmentation (random rotations, flipping) to increase dataset size and robustness.
CNN Architecture Design:

A custom CNN architecture will be designed, or existing models (e.g., VGGNet, ResNet) will be adapted.
Key components will include convolutional layers (for feature extraction), pooling layers (for dimensionality reduction), and fully connected layers (for classification).
Model Training:

The model will be trained using preprocessed MRI images with corresponding labels (tumor/non-tumor or specific tumor types).
Optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent and adaptive learning rate algorithms will be used to minimize loss.
Performance Evaluation:

The model's performance will be assessed using metrics such as:
Accuracy: Overall percentage of correctly classified images.
Precision: Percentage of true positives out of predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): Percentage of correctly identified tumors.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
